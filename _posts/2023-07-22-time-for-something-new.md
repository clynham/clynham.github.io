After a few years of using WordPress I've decided it's time to setup a website that tests my IT skills a little more, and is cheaper to run too.

At least it should be cheaper to run given I'm not expected a lot of traffic. Hosted using [GitHub Pages][github-pages] this site is built using [Jekyll][jekyll] and the [Minimal Mistakes Remote Theme][minimal-mistakes].
