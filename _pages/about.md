Chris Lynham is a British IT professional living in the South East of the UK in a role that could be described as a hybrid app support / solutions architect / cloud engineer. He has 20+ years experience working in the local government sector, usually taking out-dated legacy software that services rely on, and forcing it kicking and screaming into modern infrastructures as a cloud engineer.

When not problem solving or architecting IT solutions he can be found acting as a run lead for [Redway Runners](https://www.redwayrunners.com), following the NFL or expressing opinions as a wannabe professional cheeseburger connoisseur.
